#Click on the ''Add...'' button. Then on the wizard press the ''Next'' button.
#Click on the ''Add'' button and select the ''installation'' item and  press the ''Next'' button.
#Provide the path of your CDO platform and click on ''Finish'' button.
#Select the newly created target platform and click on ''Apply and Close'' button.
